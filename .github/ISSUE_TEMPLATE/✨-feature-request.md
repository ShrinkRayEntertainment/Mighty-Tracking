**Problem Statement**  
Briefly describe the gap or pain point you’re experiencing with Mighty Tracking.  
> e.g. “I want to see collision events so I can debug impact-heavy sections of my level.”

**Proposed Solution**  
Describe exactly what you’d like Mighty Tracking to do.  
> e.g. “Add an optional ‘Collision’ layer that plots red dots where collisions occur, sized by impact force.”

**Use Case / Scenario**  
Explain how and where you would use this feature in your project.  
> e.g. “When testing AI projectiles, I need to know where they hit environment meshes without stepping through logs.”

**Alternatives Considered**  
List any workarounds or other tools you tried and why they fell short.  
> e.g. “I tried logging collision events to Console, but it’s too noisy and hard to correlate with scene position.”

**Benefit / Impact**  
Who benefits and how this feature will improve your workflow or game.  
> e.g. “Helps level designers quickly identify and fix collision-heavy hotspots, reducing debug cycles by ~30%.”

**Mockups / Sketches (optional)**  
Attach any diagrams, screenshots or rough sketches that illustrate your idea.

**Additional Context**  
Any other notes—related assets, performance concerns, API changes, etc.
